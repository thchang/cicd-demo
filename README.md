# cicd-demo
A sandbox for learning how to set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

Uses ``numpy 1.10+``, in order to play with instaling dependencies.

Contains a sample identity function in ``src/test.py``.

Contains a single unit test in ``test/test_identity.py`` and a test runner script in ``test/run-tests.sh``.

The sample YAML file ``.github/workflows/demo-ci.yml`` is what GitHub uses to initiate the action.
